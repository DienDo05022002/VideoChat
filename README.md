## Detailed description

- During the period I wrote this application, it was a personal project and there was only one computer. So when I run two applications on one computer, the camera gets overwritten and results in an error.

- So, I wrote an "html" file to create a "peer" connection to the server, performing the p2p setup. You can watch the demo video, and the p2p setup was successful.


## I upgrade this project in the future
